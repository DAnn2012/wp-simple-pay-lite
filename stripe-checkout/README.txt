Add a simple Stripe Checkout button and overlay to your site using a shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you bring in the Stripe Checkout right onto your site, so that transactions can happen inline â€” without ruining the browsing experience for your customers.

The overlay pops up the purchase form in a pretty lightbox.

Shortcode examples:

`[stripe name="demo" amount="1000"]`
`[stripe name="demo" description="demo description" amount="1000"]`

Full shortcode documentation is in Settings > Simple Stripe Checkout after plugin is activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Full shortcode documentation is in Settings > Simple Stripe Checkout after plugin is activated.

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a stripe.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is "Google Analytics for WordPress". Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

See the official Stripe checkout [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) for further troubleshooting.
